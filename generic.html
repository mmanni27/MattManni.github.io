									<h1>My Story<br />
									</h1>
									<p>My name is Matt Manni, an aspiring data analyst with a diverse professional background. I am passionate about solving problems with data and helping people with solutions from data-driven insights. Although I do not have professional experience as a Data Analyst, I am excited to transition into this field as I embark on the next chapter of my life. My recently acquired Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and continued learning have provided me with the necessary skills to achieve my goal. </p>

								<p> <b>A little bit about my background:</b></p>
								<p> I was born and raised in Newport Beach, CA, spending most of my childhood and adult life in the area. I hold a Bachelor's degree in <b>Geology (UC Santa Barbara)</b> and a Master's degree in <b>Spatial Information (University of New South Wales)</b>. Spatial information is information about the locations and shapes of geographic features and the relationships between them. This is typically referred to as <b>GIS (Geographic Information System)</b> and includes any data with a reference to a specific geographic location. I moved to Sydney, Australia for a year to obtain my Master's degree with the goal of using my knowledge of geology and spatial information for mineral exploration in Australia. I had chosen this topic for my research paper at UNSW, using satellite imagery of North West Queensland, Australia to locate potential mining opportunities in the area. 
								  </p>
								<p> Unfortunately, that plan did not work out for me as it was difficult to find work in Australia without a working visa. So, I went back to Southern California and began my professional career. I was eager to work and took a job at <b>Clean Energy Fuels</b>. I worked on a team to achieve operational excellence as a <b>Maintenance Planner</b> for their natural gas stations throughout the US. During my time there, I was able to learn about <b>working in a corporate office environment, preventative maintenance, process improvement, and cross-functional collaboration to complete projects on schedule</b>. With not much room to grow in that department and a desire for more exciting work, I decided to pursue a job in geology, my first college degree. I was fortunate to land a job at <b>Southern California Geotechnical.</b> As a <b>Geologist</b> there, I was finally working outside again and with a great group of coworkers (not just the rocks!). I conducted field explorations and lab tests to determine critical soil properties of the land prior to commercial and industrial buildings being developed on said land. It was fun for a while, until I got to the point where I was in the field every single day. I was driving all over Southern California working long, physically demanding hours with little or no time to perform lab tests and produce field reports. It got to the point where I had to prioritize my physical and mental health over this type of work, so I decided to leave and take a bit of a sabbatical. I learned many unique skills when working there, such as <b>coordinating projects & schedules with colleagues & contractors, geotechnical analysis, and time management with multiple projects at once.</b></p>
								<p> When I was ready to get back in the job force, I was asked by a family member to help his friend with a sales opening in Los Angeles. I had no experience in outside sales so I was excited for a new challenge. However, it did not take long to determine that <b>sales was not for me</b> and at the end of my contract, we decided to split ways. As I searched for a new job in Los Angeles, a family friend reached out to me about a <b>Technical Recruiter</b> opening at <b>Apex Systems</b>. With an interest in I.T., I thought of what a great opportunity this could be for me. I interviewed and landed the job! After some training and hands-on experience as a recruiter, I slowly realized how enjoyable and rewarding this career was for me. I learned many valuable skills that can translate into all aspects of life including: <b>communication, organization, problem-solving, leadership, collaboration, and confidence in myself</b>. Everything was going very well as I succeeded in my role and was promoted to a <b>Professional Recruiter</b>, then to <b>Team Lead</b> and finally to <b>Recruiting Manager</b>. Our office had doubled both in size and revenue before the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, a lot of that changed as the world endured the global pandemic. </p>
								<p> This brings us to January 2021, where the staffing industry was still struggling and life was about to change for me. At the start of 2021, I had a minor accident in my apartment that led to a concussion. I do have a history of concussions in the past with several throughout my childhood up until the end of college. So I knew what it felt like and what to expect. However, this one felt different and I did not heal from the injury in the typical one-month time-frame. I was <b>diagnosed with Post Concussion Syndrome (PCS)</b> where the symptoms of a concussion last much longer than expected after injury. I had issues with headaches, dizziness, concentration, memory, blurry vision, fatigue, light & noise sensitivity, and a variety of psychological issues including anxiety, depression, and insomnia. I saw many doctors and went through a lot of therapy to recover. It was a very difficult year, with all the above affecting me and causing me to take a <b>medical leave of absence from work</b> and eventually permanently leave the company. I lost friends, time, and a sense of myself. <b>It took over a year to fully recover and be back to normal.</b> A new normal but I was me again. </p>
								<p> When I was physically and mentally ready to work, I decided to ease into the working world again and start part-time. I became a <b>Bank Teller at Wells Fargo</b> because I thought it would be a smooth transition following my recovery. The first few months were challenging, but it felt great to be back at work and feeling normal again. Within six months, I was working full-time at the bank and continued to grow my skills and confidence. I knew that this role was a stepping stone for a bigger and brighter future, and it has helped me tremendously. During my recovery, I had a lot of time to reflect on the important things in life and <b>how precious time on Earth truly is.</b> That is when I realized that I must do something in life that makes me happy and I decided to pursue my true passion in lifeâ€¦<b>DATA!</b> My love for analyzing any information or data to help people and businesses is what drove me towards this field. It's exciting to know that data analysis is such a <b>powerful tool to solve personal and business-related real-world problems</b>. Now, after educating myself in data analytics and getting some hands-on experience through my projects, I am ready for my next chapter in life as a <b>Data Analyst.</b> </p>
								<p> Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors and time with family and friends. Some of my favorite activities include a good hike, camping trip, playing basketball or swimming. During my free time, I like to cook, read, watch movies, do puzzles, and play video games.
